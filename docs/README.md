# Documentation

This documentation is using the [Sphinx generator](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to create the whole documentation and are building automatically using the GiHub Actions.

The custom theme is the official [Qiskit theme for Ecosystem project](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit_sphinx_theme/), do not hesitate to go check the documentation in order to know how to custimize it further.

The documentation is structured following the [Diátaxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/).
This framework is for technical documentation that divides it into 4 categories according to the users needs.

In particular, it focuses on two axes of knowledge:
- Theory/practice: when the user needs theoretical knowledge or to follow practical steps to perform a task.
- Acquisition/application: when the documentation is to be used for study or for work, that is, for acquiring or applying knowledge.

According to those axes, documentation can be divided into:
- Tutorials: Practice and acquisition. A tutorial acts as a lesson in which the writer/teacher takes the user/pupil by the hand though the steps needed to complete a project. This project should be a meaningful exercise that the user can reasonably complete, getting a sense of achievement and confidence with both our product and their skills.
- How-to guides: Practice and application. A how-to guide is, broadly speaking, a recipe for completing a task. The user is expected to be already familiar with the task and why they may want to do it. You don’t even need to start from the beginning but you can set a starting point that the user should know how to reach. You can present the different ways to approach the task but always focus on the action.
- Reference: Theory and application. The purpose of the reference is to describe, as simply and accurately as possible, how the software works. It is not tailored to any task but only to the product itself. It’s recommended to add some code examples to the reference.
- Explanation: Theory and acquisition. The intention behind explanatory material is to improve the users’ understanding of a certain topic. It’s there to answer why things are the way they are and what the implications are. Any context and connections to other subjects or concepts are welcome here, as we are not covering how to perform a task. Explanatory material must not instruct how to perform a task or give technical reference, that’s what the other 3 types are for.
